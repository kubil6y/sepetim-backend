### TYPEORM FLOAT CLASHES! ###
# https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/2812

# this shit is terrible. js has one type for numbers but postgres has many. so there is a clash. seems like there is a work around like this:

@Column({type: 'real'})
basePrice: string;

# with a solution like this, will class-validator work? anyways atm basePrice is a float but extra dish prices are int. cba fixing the rest.
